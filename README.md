# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

  
This React-based Pet Store app provides an engaging and interactive user interface, enabling users to explore various sections and pages of the pet store. The app is designed with a multi-page layout and features seamless navigation between sections through a dynamic Navbar.
Key Features:
• Homepage:
• The Navbar contains clickable components that allow users to easily navigate
to different sections of the homepage.
• The homepage includes four key sections:
i. About Us: Information about the store, its mission, and services. ii. Transport Section: Displays three transport cards (e.g., types of
transport used by the store) that each trigger a popup. Clicking on any card opens a detailed popup with additional information about that specific transport option.
iii. Contact Us: Provides store contact details, including methods of communication with the pet store.
iv. Animals Gallery: Features three images representing different types of animals (cats, dogs, and birds). Clicking on any image redirects the user to the respective animal's dedicated page.
• Animal Pages (Cats, Dogs, Birds):
• Each page presents cards for different types of animals (e.g., cat breeds, dog
breeds, or bird species).
• Clicking on an animal card triggers a popup with more detailed information
about that specific animal.
• Every animal page also includes a Navbar with a Search Bar, allowing users to
search for animals by name.
• Additionally, the Navbar has a small home icon that redirects the user back to
the Homepage. User Interaction:
• Transport Section: Users can explore different transport options by clicking cards, with popups offering additional insights.
